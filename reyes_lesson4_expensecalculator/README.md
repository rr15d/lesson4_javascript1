### Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. JavaScript is a scripting language which is most popularly used on the Internet for designing websites, validating forms, creating cookies, and much more.  JavaScript is used on all major browsers, such as Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox.
2. A scripting language is defined as a lightweight programming language.  JavaScript is a client-side scripting language, which means that the code is executed in the client or software that the viewer is using.  The software being used when one uses Javascript is the browser.
3. An identifier in JavaScript is a name assigned to a variable.  Identifiers are case-sensitive and have to adhere to a certain set of rules when creating one.  While they can use upper- and lowercase letters, the digits 0-9, underscores, and the $ sign, the first character in an identifier cannot be a digit, and there can be no spaces in the name.  Furthermore, identifiers cannot be keywords or reserved words for JavaScript.
